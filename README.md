------------ About the extension ----------

This was an extension I developed to save urls of websites that I use a lot. It is very easy and intuitive to use, as there are only three simple features:
* Save URL via input;
* Copy the guide ;
* Clear data;
------------- Browsers -------------------
* It was made especially for the Google Chrome browser
-------------- How to use ----------------------
* "SAVE INPUT" button: Just copy the website URL and paste it in the input field and press the button;
*"SAVE TAB" button: Just press it to save the URL of the tab you are currently accessing;
* "DELETE ALL" button: As its name suggests, it is used to delete all saved records. Double click this button to work!.
--------------- Saved Data ---------------
* Data was saved using Google local storage. They are only removed if the "DELETE ALL" button is pressed
--------------- Technologies used ------------------
* HTML;
* CSS;
* JAVASCRIPT
* JSON
--------------- Enabling the extension in Chrome ---------
* 1st: Go to "chrome://extensions/"
* 2nd: Click on the top "load uncompressed" button on the left side
* 3rd: Add the files and test the extension :)
